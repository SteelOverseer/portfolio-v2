    <h1>Hi, I'm Doug</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer from Rochester NY.
      I like to learn new technologies and try to build interesting things with them.
    
      I believe solutions shouldn't be complex or difficult to understand, the best solutions are elegant and easy to maintain.
