      <p>
        I'm a software engineer from Rochester NY, writing code profesionally since 2018.
        <br><br>
        In 2015 I received my degree in Computer Science from SUNY Brockport, and soon after landed my first job at a local startup as a QA Analyst.
        After a couple years, when an opportunity presented itself, I was able to move into a software engineering role.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am employed by a different local company and contract on the side to help a friends start up.
        <br><br>
        While I'm not working, I like to try to build projects in technologies that I have taken an interest in. 
        Check out my <a href="https://github.com/SteelOverseer" target="_blank">Github</a> or visit my Projects page to take a look at what I've been building!
        <br><br>
        When learning even seems like too much work, I fire up the gaming rig and play some video games. 
        I've been an avid gamer my entire life, starting with the SNES when I was young.
        <br><br>
        Other than gaming, I enjoy many different hobbies my favorite of which is collecting and playing Magic: the Gathering.
        I currently have 14 built commander decks and a handful of modern decks and play with my friends almost weekly.
